    storyDialouge: "Marlin and Dory found the diver's mask, but Dory got injured
      and started bleeding after struggling for the mask. This accidentally stirred
      up Bruce (a shark), causing him to go berserk, and they had to flee to a deep
      trench after narrowly escaping being eaten. Dory remembered that she could
      read, and they discovered that Nemo had gone to Sydney, Australia. Both Dory
      and Marlin saw a light, but then realized it was from an anglerfish, which
      intended to eat them both\u2026\r"
