    storyDialouge: A while later, Dory got caught in a fishing net along with a school
      of fish. Nemo suggested saving her by having the fish swim downward, a trick
      the other fish had used in the tank to save him from the dentist's net. Although
      Marlin feared that letting Nemo do this might cause him to lose him again,
      he realized he had to let Nemo try. The plan worked; they broke the winch,
      freeing Dory and the entire school of fish. Marlin reunited with Nemo and apologized
      for being overprotective.

    storyDialouge: Upon returning home, Marlin allowed Nemo to have adventures at
      school. He impressed and gained the respect of the neighbors for crossing the
      ocean to find his son, especially after his credibility was boosted by the
      appearance of three sharks.
